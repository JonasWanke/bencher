## Benchmark Command

The first argument to `bencher run` is the optional benchmark command.
This is the command that will be executed, invoking your benchmark harness.
It can also be set using the `BENCHER_CMD` environment variable.
By default this command is executed in a shell, which can be configured with the `--shell` and `--flag` options.
Its output is parsed by a benchmark harness adapter, which can be set using the `--adapter` option.
However, if the benchmark harness outputs to a file then the `--file` option must also be used to specify the output file path.

If you would prefer to not have the command executed in a shell, you can use the `--exec` flag or simply provide additional arguments to your command as additional arguments to `bencher run`.

Shell Form:
```bash
bencher run "bencher mock"
```

Exec Form:
```bash
bencher run bencher mock
```

The benchmark command can be run multiple times using the `--iter` option,
and those results can be folded into a single result using the `--fold` option.
If any of the iterations fail, then the entire command is considered to have failed unless the `--allow-failure` flag is set.

If the benchmark command is not specified but the `--file` option is, then `bencher run` will read from output file path instead.
If neither the benchmark command nor  `--file` option are specified, then `bencher run` will read from `stdin` instead.
This allows you to save the output of another command to a file or pipe it into `bencher run`, respectively.
