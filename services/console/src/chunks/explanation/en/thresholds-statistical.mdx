## Statistical Thresholds

All other Thresholds are Statistical Thresholds.
Each Statistical Threshold uses historical Metrics and a unique statistical significance test to determine whether an Alert is generated.
Therefore, the Lower/Upper Boundary will mean different things for different Statistical Thresholds.
In addition to setting a Lower Boundary and/or an Upper Boundary, there are controls for which historical Metrics are used (ie sampled).

- ### Minimum Sample Size
  - A minimum Sample Size can be set for a Statistical Threshold.
The Statistical Threshold will only run its statistical significance test
if the number of historical Metrics is greater than or equal to the minimum Sample Size.
The minimum Sample Size must be less than or equal to the maximum Sample Size, if both are specified.
- ### Maximum Sample Size
  - A maximum Sample Size can be set for a Statistical Threshold.
The Statistical Threshold will limit itself to only the most recent historical Metrics
capped at the maximum Sample Size for its statistical significance test.
The maximum Sample Size must be greater than or equal to the minimum Sample Size, if both are specified.
- ### Window Size
  - A Window Size in seconds can be set for a Statistical Threshold.
The Statistical Threshold will limit itself to only the most recent historical Metrics
bounded by the given time window for its statistical significance test.
