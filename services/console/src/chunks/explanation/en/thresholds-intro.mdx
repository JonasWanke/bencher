Thresholds are how you catch performance regressions with Bencher.
A Threshold is assigned to a unique combination of: Branch, Testbed, and Measure.
A Threshold must have a Lower Boundary, Upper Boundary, or both.
Each Boundary is used to calculate a Boundary Limit.
Then every new Metric is checked against each Boundary Limit.

- Lower Boundary
  - A Lower Boundary is used when a smaller value would indicate a performance regression, such as with the Throughput Measure.
- Upper Boundary
  - An Upper Boundary is used when a larger value would indicate a performance regression, such as with the Latency Measure.

There are a several types of Thresholds:

<ul>
  <li>[Static](#static-thresholds)</li>
  <li>[Statistical](#statistical-thresholds)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>[Percentage](#percentage-thresholds)</li>
    <li>[z-score](#z-score-thresholds)</li>
    <li>[t-test](#t-test-thresholds)</li>
    <li>[Log Normal](#log-normal-thresholds)</li>
    <li>[Interquartile Range (IQR)](#interquartile-range-thresholds)</li>
    <li>[Delta Interquartile Range (Î”IQR)](#delta-interquartile-range-thresholds)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
