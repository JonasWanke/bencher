The rules for FizzBuzzFibonacci are as follows:

> Write a program that prints the integers from `1` to `100` (inclusive):
> - For multiples of three, print `Fizz`
> - For multiples of five, print `Buzz`
> - For multiples of both three and five, print `FizzBuzz`
> - For numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence, only print `Fibonacci`
> - For all others, print the number

The [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
For example, starting at `0` and `1` the next number in the Fibonacci sequence would be `1`.
Followed by: `2`, `3`, `5`, `8` and so on.
Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers. So we're going to have to write a function that detects Fibonacci numbers.

There are [many ways to write the Fibonacci sequence](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) and likewise many ways to detect a Fibonacci number.
So we'll go with the my favorite:
