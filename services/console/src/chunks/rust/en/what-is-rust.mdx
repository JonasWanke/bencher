## What is Rust?

Rust is an open source programming language that emphasizes speed, reliability, and productivity.
It manages to achieve memory safety without the need for a garbage collector.

You should consider using Rust if you are writing a:
- Low-level program where performance is important
- Shared library that will be used by several different languages
- Complex Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Long-lived software project with many contributors

Rust has a strong emphasis on developer productivity.
Cargo is the official package manager,
and it handles many tasks such as:
- Managing project dependencies
- Compiling binaries, tests, and benchmarks
- Linting
- Formatting
