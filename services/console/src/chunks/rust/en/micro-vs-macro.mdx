## Micro-Benchmarking vs Macro-Benchmarking

There are two major categories of software benchmarks: micro-benchmarks and macro-benchmarks.
Micro-benchmarks operate at a level similar to unit tests.
For example, a benchmark for a function that determines `Fizz`, `Buzz`, or `FizzBuzz` for a single number would be a micro-benchmark.
Macro-benchmarks operate at a level similar to integration tests.
For example, a benchmark for a function that plays the entire game of FizzBuzz, from `1` to `100`, would be a macro-benchmark.

Generally, it is best to test at the lowest level of abstraction possible.
In the case benchmarks, this makes them both easier to maintain,
and it helps reduce noise the amount of noise in the measurements.
However, just as having some end-to-end tests can be very useful for sanity checking
the entire system comes together as expected,
having macro-benchmarks can be very useful for making sure that
the critical paths through your software remain performant.
