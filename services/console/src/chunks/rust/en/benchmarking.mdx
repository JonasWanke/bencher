## Why Benchmark Code?

Benchmarking source code is a crucial practice that helps in gauging and improving the
performance, scalability, and efficiency of your code.
It provides necessary metrics that allow developers to understand how well their code performs
under various workloads and conditions.
This insight is important in making strategic decisions towards the optimization and improvement of the code.
Moreover, it enables the identification of potential bottlenecks, slow spots,
or under-performing parts in the source code, which can then be addressed to enhance the overall software performance.
Therefore, benchmarking not only improves the quality of the software but also improves end-user satisfaction by delivering high-performing, effective, and reliable software.
