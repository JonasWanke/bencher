## What is Rust?

Rust is an open source programming language that emphasizes speed, memory safety, and productivity.
It was specifically designed to handle the demands of large-scale, concurrent systems.
Rust achieves memory safety without the need for a garbage collector,
which makes it a perfect fit for systems programming.

The language has gained popularity for applications that require complex concurrency
or a high level of security such as operating systems, file systems, game engines, and browser components.
Rustâ€™s unique combination of performance and safety features makes it an excellent choice
when considering a language for system-level programming and projects where memory-level detail control is required.
Developer productivity is also enhanced by Rust's strong emphasis on error messages and toolchains.

Cargo is the official package manager for the Rust programming language.
It proves developers with a direct method for managing project dependencies and compilation processes.
By automating many tasks, such as building the code, downloading the libraries your project relies on,
and compiling those libraries, Cargo significantly simplifies the processes and enhances the productivity for Rust developers.
Cargo also supports useful features like linting, formatting, building unit tests and benchmarks, using crates from the crates.io registry, and managing multiple native dependencies.
