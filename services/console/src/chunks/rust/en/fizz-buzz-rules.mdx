In order to write benchmarks, we need some source code to benchmark.
To start off we are going to write a very simple program,
[FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Programming).

The rules for FizzBuzz are as follows:

> Write a program that prints the integers from `1` to `100` (inclusive).
> - For multiples of three, print `Fizz`
> - For multiples of five, print `Buzz`
> - For multiples of both three and five, print `FizzBuzz`
> - For all others, print the number

There are [many ways to write FizzBuzz](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz).
So we'll go with the my favorite:
