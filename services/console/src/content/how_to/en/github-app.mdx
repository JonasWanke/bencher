If you are using Bencher Cloud, then you can simply [sign up](/auth/signup) or [log in](/auth/login)
using the `GitHub` OAuth2 button.
If you are using Bencher Self-Hosted, then you will need to create your own GitHub App.

- Create a [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app#registering-a-github-app)
- Give it a name like: Bencher Cloud for My Enterprise
- Set the `Callback URL` to: https://my-bencher-url.com/auth/github
- Identifying and authorizing users:
  - ‚úÖ Expire user authorization tokens
  - ‚úÖ Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation
  - ‚úÖ Enable Device Flow
- Webhook
  - ‚ùå Active
- Permissions
  - Account permissions
    - Email addresses: `Read-only`
- Where can this GitHub App be installed?
  - üîò Any account
- Click `Create GitHub App`
- Note the `Client ID`
- Now the app is created, under `General`
- Client secrets
  - `Generate a new client secret`
- Add a logo under Display information
- Under `Private keys` generate or upload a new private key

Set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` as an environment variable to `Client ID` when running the `bencher-ui` Docker image.
