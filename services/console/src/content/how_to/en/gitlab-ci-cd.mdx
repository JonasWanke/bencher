1. Create a GitLab CI/CD file (ex: `.gitlab-ci.yml`)
1. Create a GitLab CI/CD `job` (ex: `benchmark_with_bencher`)
1. Select a Docker image to run your job in (ex: `image: rust:bullseye`)
1. The Project must already exist. Set the `--project` flag or the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable to the Project slug or UUID. (ex: `BENCHER_PROJECT: save-walter-white`)
1. Add `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` to your project's CI/CD secrets, under `Settings -> CI / CD -> Variables -> Add Variable`
1. The API token must already exist. Set the `--token` flag or the `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` environment variable to the API token. (ex: `BENCHER_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BENCHER_API_TOKEN }}`)
1. Optional: Set the `--adapter` flag or the `BENCHER_ADAPTER` environment variable to the desired adapter name. If this is not set, then the `magic` Adapter will be used. See [benchmark harness adapters](/docs/explanation/adapters/) for a full overview. (ex: `BENCHER_ADAPTER: json`)
1. Optional: Set the `--testbed` flag or the `BENCHER_TESTBED` environment variable to the Testbed slug or UUID. The Testbed **must** already exist. If this is not set, then the `localhost` Testbed will be used. (ex: `BENCHER_TESTBED: bullseye`)
1. Download and install the Bencher CLI from a `.deb`.
1. [Track your benchmarks](/docs/how-to/track-benchmarks/) with the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand:
    1. There are several options for setting the project branch. See [branch selection](/docs/explanation/branch-selection/) for a full overview. The provided command uses [GitLab CI/CD predefined variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html) and it tries to:
        1. Use the current branch if it already exists. (ex: `--if-branch "$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME"`)
        1. Create a clone of MR target branch data and thresholds if it already exists. (ex: `--else-if-branch  "$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME"`)
        1. Otherwise, create a clone of the `main` branch data and thresholds. (ex: `--else-if-branch main`)
    1. Set the command to fail if an Alert is generated. In order for an Alert to be generated, a [Threshold](/docs/explanation/thresholds/) must already exist. (ex: `--err`)
    1. Run your benchmarks and generate a Report from the results. (ex: `"bencher mock"`)
