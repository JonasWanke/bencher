## What is Rust?

Rust is an open source programming language that emphasizes speed, reliability, and productivity.
It manages to achieve memory safety without the need for a garbage collector.

You should consider using Rust if you are writing a:
- Low-level program where performance is important
- Shared library that will be used by several different languages
- Complex Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Long-lived software project with many contributors

Rust has a strong emphasis on developer productivity.
Cargo is the official package manager,
and it handles many tasks such as:
- Managing project dependencies
- Compiling binaries, tests, and benchmarks
- Linting
- Formatting

## Write FizzBuzz in Rust

<FizzBuzzRules />

```rust
fn main() {
    for i in 1..=100 {
        match (i % 3, i % 5) {
            (0, 0) => println!("FizzBuzz"),
            (0, _) => println!("Fizz"),
            (_, 0) => println!("Buzz"),
            (_, _) => println!("{i}"),
        }
    }
}
```

- Create a `main` function
- Iterate from `1` to `100` inclusively.
- For each number, calculate the modulus (remainder after division) for both `3` and `5`.
- Pattern match on the two remainders.
    If the remainder is `0`, then the number is a multiple of the given factor.
- If the remainder is `0` for both `3` and `5` then print `FizzBuzz`.
- If the remainder is `0` for only `3` then print `Fizz`.
- If the remainder is `0` for only `5` then print `Buzz`.
- Otherwise, just print the number.

### Follow Step-by-Step

In order to follow along with this set-by-step tutorial, you will need to [install Rust](https://rustup.rs/).

With Rust installed, you can then open a terminal window and enter: `cargo init game`

Then navigate into the newly created `game` directory.

```
game
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs
```

You should see a directory called `src` with file named `main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Replace its contents with the above FizzBuzz implementation. Then run `cargo run`.
The output should look like:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/home/bencher)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.44s
     Running `target/debug/game`

FizzBuzz
...

```

> üê∞ Boom! You're cracking the coding interview!

A new `Cargo.lock` file should have been generated:

```
game
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.lock
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs
```

Before going any further, it is important to discuss the differences between micro-benchmarking and macro-benchmarking.

<MicroVsMacro />

## Benchmarking in Rust

The three popular options for benchmarking in Rust are:
[libtest bench](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html#benchmarks),
[Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs), and
[Iai](https://github.com/bheisler/iai).

libtest is Rust's built-in unit testing and benchmarking framework.
Though part of the Rust standard library, libtest bench is still considered unstable,
so it is only available on `nightly` compiler releases.
To work on the stable Rust compiler,
[a separate benchmarking harness](https://github.com/bluss/bencher)
needs to be used.
Neither is being actively developed, though.

The most actively maintained benchmarking harness within the Rust ecosystem is Criterion.
It works on both stable and `nightly` Rust compiler releases,
and it has become the de facto standard within the Rust community.
Criterion is also much more feature-rich compared to libtest bench.

An experimental alternative to Criterion is Iai, from the same creator as Criterion.
However, it uses instruction counts instead of wall clock time:
CPU instructions, L1 accesses, L2 access and RAM accesses.
This allows for single-shot benchmarking since these metrics should stay nearly identical between runs.

All three are [support by Bencher](/docs/explanation/adapters). So why choose libtest bench?
It may be a good idea if you are trying to limit the external dependencies of your project
and your project is already using the `nightly` toolchain.
Outside of that, I would suggest using either Criterion or Iai depending on your use case.

### Install Rust `nightly`

With all that said, we're going to use libtest bench, so let's set our Rust toolchain to `nightly`.
Create a `rust-toolchain.toml` file in the root of your `game` project, next to `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = "nightly"
```

Your directory structure should now look like this:

```
game
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.lock
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rust-toolchain.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs
```

Once that is complete, rerun `cargo run`.
It should take minute for the new, nightly toolchain to install
before rerunning and giving you the same output as before.

### Refactor FizzBuzz

In order to test our FizzBuzz application, we need to decouple our logic from program's `main` function.
Benchmark harnesses can't benchmark the `main` function.

Update your code to look like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    for i in 1..=100 {
        play_game(i);
    }
}

pub fn play_game(n: u32) {
    println!("{}", fizz_buzz(n));
}

pub fn fizz_buzz(n: u32) -> String {
    match (n % 3, n % 5) {
        (0, 0) => "FizzBuzz".to_string(),
        (0, _) => "Fizz".to_string(),
        (_, 0) => "Buzz".to_string(),
        (_, _) => n.to_string(),
    }
}
```

We have now separated our code out into three different functions:

- `main`: Then main entrypoint into our program that iterates through the numbers `1` to `100` inclusive and calls `play_game` for each number.
- `play_game`: Takes in an unsigned integer `n`, calls `fizz_buzz` with that number, and prints the result.
- `fizz_buzz`: Takes in an unsigned integer `n` and performs the actual `Fizz`, `Buzz`, `FizzBuzz`, or number logic returning the result as a string.

## Benchmarking FizzBuzz

In order to use the unstable libtest crate we need to enable the `test` feature for our code and import the `test` crate. Add the following to the _very top_ of `main.rs`:

```rust
#![feature(test)]
extern crate test;
```

Now we're ready to add our first benchmark!
Add the following to the _very bottom_ of `main.rs`:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod benchmarks {
    use test::Bencher;

    use super::play_game;

    #[bench]
    fn bench_play_game(b: &mut Bencher) {
        b.iter(|| {
            std::hint::black_box(for i in 1..=100 {
                play_game(i)
            });
        });
    }
}
```

- Create a module named `benchmarks` and has the
  [compiler configuration](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html#the-cfg-attribute)
  set to [`test` mode](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#the-tests-module-and-cfgtest).
- Import the `Bencher` benchmark runner. (üê∞ Hey, cool name!)
- Import our `play_game` function.
- Create a benchmark named `bench_play_game` that takes in a mutable reference to `Bencher`.
- Set the `#[bench]` attribute to indicate that `bench_play_game` is a benchmark.
- Use the `Bencher` instance (`b`) to run our benchmark several times.
- Run our benchmarks inside of a "black box" so the compiler doesn't optimize our code.
- Iterate from `1` to `100` inclusively.
- For each number, call `play_game`.

Now we're ready to benchmark our code, run `cargo bench`:

```
$ cargo bench
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/home/bencher)
    Finished bench [optimized] target(s) in 0.02s
     Running unittests src/main.rs (target/release/deps/game-68f58c96f4025bd4)

running 1 test
test benchmarks::bench_play_game ... bench:       4,879 ns/iter (+/- 170)

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 1 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.68s
```

> üê∞ Lettuce turnip the beet! We've got our first benchmark metrics!

Finally, we can rest our weary developer heads...
Just kidding, our users want a new feature!

## Write FizzBuzzFibonacci in Rust

Our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are down, so our Product Manager (PM) wants us to add a new feature.
After much brainstorming and many user interviews, it is decided that good ole FizzBuzz isn't enough.
Kids these days want a new game, FizzBuzzFibonacci.

<FizzBuzzFibonacciRules />

```rust
fn is_fibonacci_number(n: u32) -> bool {
    for i in 0..=n {
        let (mut previous, mut current) = (0, 1);
        while current < i {
            let next = previous + current;
            previous = current;
            current = next;
        }
        if current == n {
            return true;
        }
    }
    false
}
```

- Create a function named `is_fibonacci_number` that takes in an unsigned integer and returns a boolean.
- Iterate for all number from `0` to our given number `n` inclusive.
- Initialize our Fibonacci sequence starting with `0` and `1` as the `previous` and `current` numbers respectively.
- Iterate while the `current` number is less than the current iteration `i`.
- Add the `previous` and `current` number to get the `next` number.
- Update the `previous` number to the `current` number.
- Update the `current` number to the `next` number.
- Once `current` is greater than or equal to the given number `n`, we will exit the loop.
- Check to see is the `current` number is equal to the given number `n` and if so return `true`.
- Otherwise, return `false`.

Now we will need to update our `fizz_buzz` function:

```rust
pub fn fizz_buzz_fibonacci(n: u32) -> String {
    if is_fibonacci_number(n) {
        "Fibonacci".to_string()
    } else {
        match (n % 3, n % 5) {
            (0, 0) => "FizzBuzz".to_string(),
            (0, _) => "Fizz".to_string(),
            (_, 0) => "Buzz".to_string(),
            (_, _) => n.to_string(),
        }
    }
}
```

- Rename the `fizz_buzz` function to `fizz_buzz_fibonacci` to make it more descriptive.
- Call our `is_fibonacci_number` helper function.
- If the result from `is_fibonacci_number` is `true` then return `Fibonacci`.
- If the result from `is_fibonacci_number` is `false` then perform the same `Fizz`, `Buzz`, `FizzBuzz`, or number logic returning the result.

Because we rename `fizz_buzz` to `fizz_buzz_fibonacci` we also need to update our `play_game` function:

```rust
pub fn play_game(n: u32) {
    println!("{}", fizz_buzz_fibonacci(n));
}
```

Both our `main` and `bench_play_game` functions can stay exactly the same.

## Benchmarking FizzBuzzFibonacci

Now we can rerun our benchmark:

```
$ cargo bench
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/home/bencher)
    Finished bench [optimized] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running unittests src/main.rs (target/release/deps/game-68f58c96f4025bd4)

running 1 test
test benchmarks::bench_play_game ... bench:      22,167 ns/iter (+/- 502)

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 1 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.62s
```

Scrolling back through our terminal history,
we can make an eyeball comparison between the performance of our FizzBuzz and FizzBuzzFibonacci games: `4,879 ns` vs `22,167 ns`.
Your numbers will be a little different than mine.
However, the difference between the two games is likely in the 5x range.
That seems good to me! Especially for adding a feature as fancy sounding as _Fibonacci_ to our game.
The kids will love it!

## Expand FizzBuzzFibonacci in Rust

Our game is a hit! The kids do indeed love playing FizzBuzzFibonacci.
So much so that word has come down from the execs that they want a sequel.
But this is the modern world, we need Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) not one time purchases.
The new vision for our game is that it is open ended, no more living between the bound of `1` and `100` (even if it is inclusive).
No, we're on to new frontiers!

<FizzBuzzFibonacciOpenRules />

In order to have our game work for any number, we will need to accept a command line argument.
Update the `main` function to look like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();
    let i = args
        .get(1)
        .map(|s| s.parse::<u32>())
        .unwrap_or(Ok(15))
        .unwrap_or(15);
    play_game(i);
}
```

- Collect all of the arguments (`args`) passed to our game from the command line.
- Get the first argument passed to our game and parse it as an unsigned integer `i`.
- If parsing fails or no argument is passed in, default to playing our game with `15` as the input.
- Finally, play our game with the newly parsed unsigned integer `i`.

Now we can play our game with any number!
Use `cargo run` followed by `--` to pass arguments to our game:

```
$ cargo run -- 9
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/home/bencher)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.44s
     Running `target/debug/game 9`
Fizz
```

```
$ cargo run -- 10
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
     Running `target/debug/game 10`
Buzz
```

```
$ cargo run -- 13
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target/debug/game 13`
Fibonacci
```

And if we omit or provide an invalid number:

```
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
     Running `target/debug/game`
FizzBuzz
```

```
$ cargo run -- bad
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.05s
     Running `target/debug/game bad`
FizzBuzz
```

Wow, that was some thorough testing! CI passes. Our bosses are thrilled.
Let's ship it! üöÄ

## Just kidding! Everything is on fire! üî•

Well, at first everything seemed to be going fine.
And then at 02:07 AM on Saturday my pager went off:

> üìü Your game is on fire! üî•

After scrambling out of bed, I tried to figure out what was going on.
I tried to search through the logs, but that was hard because everything kept crashing.
Finally, I found the issue. The kids! They loved our game so much, they were playing it all the way up to a million!
In a flash of brilliance, I added two new benchmarks:

```rust
#[bench]
fn bench_play_game_100(b: &mut Bencher) {
    b.iter(|| std::hint::black_box(play_game(100)));
}

#[bench]
fn bench_play_game_1_000_000(b: &mut Bencher) {
    b.iter(|| std::hint::black_box(play_game(1_000_000)));
}
```

- A benchmark `bench_play_game_100` for playing the game with the number one hundred (`100`)
- A benchmark `bench_play_game_1_000_000` for playing the game with the number one million (`1_000_000`)

When I ran it, I got this:

```
$ cargo bench
   Compiling game v0.1.0 (/home/bencher)
    Finished bench [optimized] target(s) in 0.75s
     Running unittests src/main.rs (target/release/deps/game-6e1cb3355509b761)

test benchmarks::bench_play_game_100       ... bench:         439 ns/iter (+/- 21)

```

Wait for it... wait for it...

```
$ cargo bench
   Compiling game v0.1.0 (/home/bencher)
    Finished bench [optimized] target(s) in 0.75s
     Running unittests src/main.rs (target/release/deps/game-6e1cb3355509b761)

test benchmarks::bench_play_game_100       ... bench:         439 ns/iter (+/- 21)
test benchmarks::bench_play_game_1_000_000 ... bench:   9,586,977 ns/iter (+/- 158,821)

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 3 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 9.82s
```

What! `439 ns` x `1,000` should be `439,000 ns` not `9,586,977 ns` ü§Ø
Even though I got my Fibonacci sequence code functionally correct, I must have a performance bug in there somewhere.

## Fix FizzBuzzFibonacci in Rust

Let's take another look at that `is_fibonacci_number` function:

```rust
fn is_fibonacci_number(n: u32) -> bool {
    for i in 0..=n {
        let (mut previous, mut current) = (0, 1);
        while current < i {
            let next = previous + current;
            previous = current;
            current = next;
        }
        if current == n {
            return true;
        }
    }
    false
}
```

Now that I'm thinking about performance, I do realize that I have an unnecessary, extra loop.
We can completely get rid of the `for i in 0..=n {}` loop and
just compare the `current` value to the given number (`n`) ü§¶

```rust
fn is_fibonacci_number(n: u32) -> bool {
    let (mut previous, mut current) = (0, 1);
    while current < n {
        let next = previous + current;
        previous = current;
        current = next;
    }
    current == n
}
```

- Update your `is_fibonacci_number` function.
- Initialize our Fibonacci sequence starting with `0` and `1` as the `previous` and `current` numbers respectively.
- Iterate while the `current` number is less than the _given number_ `n`.
- Add the `previous` and `current` number to get the `next` number.
- Update the `previous` number to the `current` number.
- Update the `current` number to the `next` number.
- Once `current` is greater than or equal to the given number `n`, we will exit the loop.
- Check to see if the `current` number is equal to the given number `n` and return that result.

Now lets rerun those benchmarks and see how we did:

```
$ cargo bench
   Compiling game v0.1.0 (/home/bencher)
    Finished bench [optimized] target(s) in 0.75s
     Running unittests src/main.rs (target/release/deps/game-6e1cb3355509b761)

running 3 tests
test benchmarks::bench_play_game           ... bench:       5,570 ns/iter (+/- 390)
test benchmarks::bench_play_game_100       ... bench:          46 ns/iter (+/- 3)
test benchmarks::bench_play_game_1_000_000 ... bench:          53 ns/iter (+/- 4)

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 3 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 9.24s
```

Oh, wow! Our `bench_play_game` benchmark is back down to around where it was for the original FizzBuzz.
I wish I could remember exactly what that score was. It's been three weeks though.
My terminal history doesn't go back that far.
But I think it's close!

The `bench_play_game_100` benchmark is down nearly 10x, `439 ns` to `46 ns`.
And the `bench_play_game_1_000_000` benchmark is down more than 10,000x! `9,586,977 ns` to `53 ns`!

> üê∞ Hey, at least we caught this performance bug before it made it to production... oh, right. Nevermind...


## Catch Performance Regressions in CI

The execs weren't happy about the deluge of negative reviews our game received due to my little performance bug.
They told me not to let it happen again, and when I asked how, they just told me not to do it again.
How am I supposed to manage that‚ÄΩ

Luckily, I've found this awesome open source tool called Bencher.
There's a super generous free tier, so I can just use [Bencher Cloud](/) for my personal projects.
And at work where everything needs to be in our private cloud, I've started using [Bencher Self-Hosted](/docs/tutorial/docker).

Bencher has a [built in adapter for libtest bench](/docs/explanation/adapters#-rust-bench),
so it's easy to integrate into CI. After [following the Quick Start guide](/docs/tutorial/quick-start),
I'm able to run my benchmarks and track them with Bencher.

Using this nifty time travel device that a nice rabbit gave me,
I was able to go back in time and replay what would have happened if we were using Bencher the whole time.
Unlucky version #13 is where we first pushed the buggy FizzBuzzFibonacci implementation.
I immediately got failures in CI as a comment on my pull request.
That same day, I fixed the performance bug, getting rid of that needless, extra loop.
No fires. Just happy users.

[Bencher](/pricing) is a suite of continuous benchmarking tools.
Have you ever had a performance regression impact your users?
Bencher could have prevented that from happening.
Bencher allows you to detect and prevent performance regressions _before_ they make it to production.

- **Run**: Run your benchmarks locally or in CI using your favorite benchmarking tools. The `bencher` CLI simply wraps your existing benchmark harness and stores its results.
- **Track**: Track the results of your benchmarks over time. Monitor, query, and graph the results using the Bencher web console based on the source branch, testbed, and metric kind.
- **Catch**: Catch performance regressions in CI. Bencher uses state of the art, customizable analytics to detect performance regressions before they make it to production.

For the same reasons that unit tests are run in CI to prevent feature regressions, benchmarks should be run in CI with Bencher to prevent performance regressions. Performance bugs are bugs!
