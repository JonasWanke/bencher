## What is Bencher?

<DockerSelfHosted />

## Run Bencher UI & API Servers

In order to run the UI and API servers in this tutorial you will need to have `docker` installed.
Check to see if you have `docker` installed.

Run: `docker --version`

You should see something like:

<DockerVersionOutput />

It is okay if your version number is different. It's just important that this command works.
If not follow the [instructions for installing `docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

<br />

With `docker` installed, we can now run the UI and API servers.

Run: `bencher up`

You should see something like:

<DockerBencherUpOutput />

Again, it is okay if your output is different. It's just important that this command works.

> üê∞ If you get an error from ghcr.io saying `"authentication required"` try running `docker logout ghcr.io`

## Bencher API Server Logs

Because we won't have set up email/SMTP on the API server yet,
the confirmation codes you will receive later in the tutorial are going to be in the server logs.

<br />

## Set Bencher Host

The `bencher` CLI default host is Bencher Cloud (ie [https://api.bencher.dev](https://api.bencher.dev)).
So you need to set your hostname. The easiest way to do this is the with `BENCHER_HOST` environment variable.

Run: `export BENCHER_HOST=http://localhost:61016`

If you then run: `echo $BENCHER_HOST`

You should see:

<DockerBencherHostOutput />

<br />
