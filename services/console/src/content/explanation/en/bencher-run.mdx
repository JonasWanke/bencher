`bencher run` is the most popular CLI subcommand.
It is used to run benchmarks and report the results.
As such, it is one of the most complicated subcommands.
This page will explain the options, flags, and arguments that can be passed to `bencher run`.

## Benchmark Command

The first and only argument to `bencher run` is the optional benchmark command.
This is the command that will be executed, invoking your benchmark harness.
It can also be set using the `BENCHER_CMD` environment variable.
The command is executed in a shell, which can be configured with the `--shell` and `--flag` options.
Its output is parsed by a benchmark harness adapter, which can be set using the `--adapter` option.
However, if the benchmark harness outputs to a file then the `--file` option must also be used to specify the output file path.

<br />

> üê∞ If your benchmark command is multiple words, then you must wrap it in quotes (ie `bencher run "bencher mock"`).

<br />

The benchmark command can be run multiple times using the `--iter` option,
and those results can be folded into a single result using the `--fold` option.
If any of the iterations fail, then the entire command is considered to have failed unless the `--allow-failure` flag is set.

If the benchmark command is not specified but the `--file` option is, then `bencher run` will read from output file path instead.
If both the benchmark command and  `--file` option are not specified, then `bencher run` will read from `stdin` instead.
This allows you to save the output of another command to a file or pipe it into `bencher run`, respectively.

## Options

### `--project <PROJECT>`

<br />

Either the `--project` option or the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable
must be set to the slug or UUID of an already existing project.
If both are defined, the `--project` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_PROJECT` environment variable.

<br />

### `--token <TOKEN>`

<br />

Either the `--token` option or the `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` environment variable must be set to a valid API token.
If both are defined, the `--token` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

<br />

### `--branch <BRANCH>`
### `--if-branch <IF_BRANCH>`
### `--else-if-branch <ELSE_IF_BRANCH>`
### `--else-branch`
### `--endif-branch`

<br />

See [branch selection](/docs/explanation/branch-selection) for a full overview.

<br />

### `--hash <HASH>`

<br />

Optional: A 40-character SHA-1 commit hash.
If two reports have the same branch and hash, they will be considered to be from the same commit.
Therefore, they will have the same branch version number.

<br />

### `--testbed <TESTBED>`

<br />

Optional: Either the `--testbed` option or the `BENCHER_TESTBED` environment variable
may be set to the slug or UUID of an already existing testbed.
If both are defined, the `--testbed` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_TESTBED` environment variable.
If neither are defined then `localhost` is used as the default testbed.

<br />

### `--adapter <ADAPTER>`
### `--average <AVERAGE>`
### `--file <FILE>`

<br />

See [benchmark harness adapter](/docs/explanation/adapters) for a full overview.

<br />

### `--iter <ITER>`

<br />

Optional: Number of run iterations. The default is `1`.

### `--fold <FOLD>`

<br />

Optional: Fold multiple results into a single result. \
Requires: `--iter` to be set. \
Possible values:
    - `min`:    Minimum value
    - `max`:    Maximum value
    - `mean`:   Mean of values
    - `median`: Median of values

<br />

### `--backdate <DATETIME_SECONDS>`

<br />

Optional: Backdate the report (seconds since epoch).
NOTE: This will *not* effect the ordering of past reports!
This is useful when initially seeding historical data into a project in _chronological_ order.

<br />

### `--allow-failure`

<br />

Optional: Allow benchmark test failure.

<br />

### `--err`

<br />

Optional: Error when an alert is generated. See [thresholds and alerts](/docs/explanation/thresholds) for a full overview.

<br />

### `--html`

<br />

Optional: Output results in HTML format.

<br />

### `--ci-only-thresholds`

<br />

Optional: Only post results to CI if [a Threshold](/docs/explanation/thresholds) exists for the Metric Kind, Branch, and Testbed.
If no Thresholds exist, then nothing will be posted.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br />

### `--ci-only-on-alert`

<br />

Optional: Only start posting results to CI if [an Alert](/docs/explanation/thresholds) is generated.
If an Alert is generated, then follow up results, even if they don't contain any Alerts, will also be posted.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br />

### `--ci-id`

<br />

Optional: Custom ID for posting results to CI.
By default, Bencher will automatically segment out results by the combination of: Project, Branch, Testbed, and [Adapter](/docs/explanation/adapters).
Setting a custom ID is useful when Bencher is being run multiple times in the same CI workflow for the same Project, Branch, Testbed, and Adapter combination.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br/>

### `--ci-number`

<br />

Optional: Issue number for posting results to CI.
Bencher will try its best to detect the CI issue number needed to post results.
However, this isn't always available in complex setups, like using `workflow_run` in GitHub Actions.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br/>

### `--github-actions`

<br />

Optional: Set the GitHub API authentication token (ie `--github-actions ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`).
When this option is set and `bencher run` is used in GitHub Actions as a part of a pull request,
then the results will be added to the pull request as a comment.
The most convenient way to do this is the [GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).

> üê∞ If you are running inside of a Docker container within GitHub Action, you will need to pass in the following environment variables and mount the path specified by `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`:
> - `GITHUB_ACTIONS`
> - `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`
> - `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`

<br />

### `--shell <SHELL>`

<br />

Optional: Shell command path. Defaults to `/bin/sh` on Unix-like environments and `cmd` on Windows.

<br />

### `--flag <FLAG>`

<br />

Optional: Shell command flag. Defaults to `-c` on Unix-like environments and `/C` on Windows.

<br />

### `--host <HOST>`

<br />

Optional: Backend host URL. Defaults to [https://api.bencher.dev](https://api.bencher.dev).

<br />

### `--attempts <ATTEMPTS>`

<br />

Optional: Max request retry attempts. Defaults to `10`.

<br />


### `--retry-after <RETRY_AFTER>`

<br />

Optional: Initial seconds to wait between attempts (exponential backoff). The default is `1`.

<br />

### `--dry-run`

<br />

Optional: Perform a dry run. This will not store any data to the backend.
Neither a Report nor Branch as detailed in [branch selection](/docs/explanation/branch-selection) will be created.

<br />

### `-h`
### `--help`

<br />

Optional: Print help.
