## Options

<BencherRunProject />

<br />

<BencherRunToken />

<br />

<BencherRunBranchSelection />

<br />

<BencherRunHash />

<br />

### `--testbed <TESTBED>`

<br />

Optional: Either the `--testbed` option or the `BENCHER_TESTBED` environment variable
may be set to the name, slug, or UUID of an already existing testbed.
If both are defined, the `--testbed` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_TESTBED` environment variable.
If neither are defined then `localhost` is used as the default testbed.

<br />

### `--adapter <ADAPTER>`
### `--average <AVERAGE>`
### `--file <FILE>`

<br />

See [benchmark harness adapter](/docs/explanation/adapters/) for a full overview.

<br />

### `--iter <ITER>`

<br />

Optional: Number of run iterations. The default is `1`.

### `--fold <FOLD>`

<br />

Optional: Fold multiple results into a single result. \
Requires: `--iter` to be set. \
Possible values:
    - `min`:    Minimum value
    - `max`:    Maximum value
    - `mean`:   Mean of values
    - `median`: Median of values

<br />

### `--backdate <DATETIME_SECONDS>`

<br />

Optional: Backdate the report (seconds since epoch).
NOTE: This will *not* effect the ordering of past reports!
This is useful when initially seeding historical data into a project in _chronological_ order.

<br />

### `--allow-failure`

<br />

Optional: Allow benchmark test failure.

<br />

### `--err`

<br />

Optional: Error when an alert is generated. See [thresholds and alerts](/docs/explanation/thresholds/) for a full overview.

<br />

### `--html`

<br />

Optional: Output results in HTML format.

<br />

### `--quiet`

<br />

Optional: Quite mode, only output the final Report JSON. Default is `false`.

<br />

### `--ci-no-metrics`

<br />

Optional: Omit Benchmark Metrics and Boundary Limits from results.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br />

### `--ci-only-thresholds`

<br />

Optional: Only post results to CI if [a Threshold](/docs/explanation/thresholds/) exists for the Branch, Testbed, and Measure.
If no Thresholds exist, then nothing will be posted.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br />

### `--ci-only-on-alert`

<br />

Optional: Only start posting results to CI if [an Alert](/docs/explanation/thresholds/) is generated.
If an Alert is generated, then follow up results, even if they don't contain any Alerts, will also be posted.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br />

### `--ci-id <ID>`

<br />

Optional: Custom ID for posting results to CI.
By default, Bencher will automatically segment out results by the combination of: Project, Branch, Testbed, and [Adapter](/docs/explanation/adapters/).
Setting a custom ID is useful when Bencher is being run multiple times in the same CI workflow for the same Project, Branch, Testbed, and Adapter combination.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br/>

### `--ci-number <NUMBER>`

<br />

Optional: Issue number for posting results to CI.
Bencher will try its best to detect the CI issue number needed to post results.
However, this isn't always available in complex setups, like using `workflow_run` in GitHub Actions.
Requires: `--github-actions`

<br/>

### `--github-actions <GITHUB_TOKEN>`

<br />

Optional: Set the GitHub API authentication token (ie `--github-actions ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`).
When this option is set and `bencher run` is used in GitHub Actions as a part of a pull request,
then the results will be added to the pull request as a comment.
The most convenient way to do this is the [GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).

> üê∞ If you are running inside of a Docker container within GitHub Action, you will need to pass in the following environment variables and mount the path specified by `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`:
> - `GITHUB_ACTIONS`
> - `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`
> - `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`

<br />

### `--shell <SHELL>`

<br />

Optional: Shell command path. Defaults to `/bin/sh` on Unix-like environments and `cmd` on Windows.

<br />

### `--flag <FLAG>`

<br />

Optional: Shell command flag. Defaults to `-c` on Unix-like environments and `/C` on Windows.

<br />

<BencherRunExec />

<br />

### `--host <URL>`

<br />

Optional: Backend host URL. Defaults to [https://api.bencher.dev](https://api.bencher.dev).

<br />

### `--attempts <ATTEMPTS>`

<br />

Optional: Max request retry attempts. Defaults to `10`.

<br />


### `--retry-after <RETRY_AFTER_SECONDS>`

<br />

Optional: Initial seconds to wait between attempts (exponential backoff). The default is `1`.

<br />

### `--strict`

<br />

Optional: Strictly parse JSON responses. Default is `false`.
Enabling this feature will require more frequent client updates due to breaking changes.

<br />

### `--dry-run`

<br />

Optional: Perform a dry run. This will not store any data to the backend.
Neither a Report nor Branch as detailed in [branch selection](/docs/explanation/branch-selection/) will be created.

<br />

### `-h`
### `--help`

<br />

Optional: Print help.
