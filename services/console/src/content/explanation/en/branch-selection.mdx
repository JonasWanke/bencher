There are a few ways for setting the project branch in the <code><a href="/docs/explanation/bencher-run/">bencher run</a></code> CLI subcommand.
If none of these options or flags are used then `main` is used as the default branch.

<br />

### `--branch`

<br />

The simplest way is to set the `--branch` option or the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable to the slug or UUID of an already existing branch.
If both are defined, the `--branch` option takes precedence over the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable.

However, if both of these are missing or the provided value is invalid, then the `bencher run` command will error.
This is not the most convenient in CI/CD environments, where new branches are popping up all the time.
Instead of using `--branch` or the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable, there is an `--if-branch` option.

<br />

### `--if-branch`

<br />

The `--if-branch` option expects a branch _name_ argument and queries to see if a single branch with that name exists.
If there is exactly one branch found, then `bencher run` proceeds using that branch.
Otherwise, `bencher run` will simply log and exit successfully.

For example, if `main` exists then using `--if-branch main` would find it. Then `bencher run` would proceed using `main`.

The `--branch` option conflicts with the `--if-branch` option, but the `BENCHER_BRANCH` environment variable takes precedent over the `--if-branch` option.

<br />

> üê∞ Note: Whenever using environment variables they should be wrapped in double quotes (ie `--if-branch "$MY_ENV_VAR"`).

<br />

### `--else-if-branch`

<br />

Often, when working on feature branches, it would be useful to have historical data from the parent/base branch.
This is where the `--else-if-branch` option comes in.
The `--else-if-branch` option expects another branch _name_ argument.
If `--if-branch` fails, then `--else-if-branch` queries to see if a single branch with that name exists.
If there is exactly one branch found, then all the data and thresholds from this starting point branch will be copied over to a newly created branch with the name given to `--if-branch`.

For example, if `feature_branch` does not yet exist, but `main` does exist and has historical data.
Then using `--if-branch feature_branch --else-if-branch main`, would create a new branch named `feature_branch`,
and it would have a copy of all the data and thresholds from `main`.
Then `bencher run` would proceed using `feature_branch`.

It is also possible to use multiple `--else-if-branch` options.
For example if `mia_branch` does not exist, `--if-branch feature_branch --else-if-branch mia_branch --else-if-branch main`
would effectively function the same as the previous example, copying all of the data and thresholds from `main` and proceeding.

If the `--if-branch` query succeeds then `--else-if-branch` is never run, and if both `--if-branch` and `--else-if-branch` fail, `bencher run` will simply log and exit successfully.

### `--else-branch`

<br />

To guarantee in all cases that the metrics from a run are stored, there is an `--else-branch` flag.
The `--else-branch` flag takes no arguments.
If `--if-branch` fails, then `--else-branch` simply creates a new branch with the name given to `--if-branch`.

For example, if `feature_branch` does not yet exist.
Then using `--if-branch feature_branch --else-branch`, would create a new branch named `feature_branch`,
and it would have no initial data nor thresholds.
Then `bencher run` would proceed using `feature_branch`.

It is also possible to chain all three flags together: `--if-branch`, `--else-if-branch`, and `--else-branch`.
For example, `--if-branch feature_branch --else-if-branch main --else-branch`.

If the `--if-branch` query succeeds then `--else-branch` is never run, and likewise, if `--if-else-branch` succeeds then `--else-branch` is never run.
And `--else-branch` is expected to always succeed and exit successfully.

<br />

### `--endif-branch`

<br />

The `--endif-branch` flag works as an optional noop flag to indicate the end of the `--if-branch` statement.

It is possible to chain all four flags together: `--if-branch`, `--else-if-branch`, `--else-branch`, and `--endif-branch`.
For example, `--if-branch feature_branch --else-if-branch "$MY_ENV_VAR" --else-branch --endif-branch`.
